    <h2>Get certified</h2>
    <p>Some cybersecurity jobs require a specific degree or certification, so it’s important to be aware of this before you begin looking for jobs. Cybersecurity skills are in high demand, but there are also specific certifications that indicate proficiency in specific areas. There are different paths you can take to become certified in cybersecurity, depending on your interests and career goals. Cybersecurity certifications are becoming more and more popular to boost your CV because they show evidence of a person’s experience, expertise, and skills. If you want to get some certifications, it’s important to keep in mind that it can be a long-term process. Some certification take years to attain. It’s also important to keep in mind the type of certifications you want to get. In general, there are two types of cybersecurity certifications: - Industry certifications - These certifications are designed to demonstrate a demonstrated knowledge in one particular field. One example is the CompTIA Security+. You can find any industry-focused certifications that may be relevant to your field. This can also be helpful if you are changing careers. - focused certifications - These certifications are focused on a certain area of cybersecurity. For example, you can find certifications for Microsoft 365 or Cisco.</p>
    <h3>What certification should I get?</h3>
    <p>Typically, I recommend earning a certificate with a focused mindset first. While the Security+ certificate is great, it doesn't teach you how to apply what you've learned. On the otherhand, the Microsoft 365 security administrator certificate will teach you exactly what to apply and how to apply it.</p>
    <h3>How to get certified?</h3>
    <p>Many certificates can be learned and earned 100% online. In short, you need to read a lot. Then you need to apply what you learned. Finally, take a couple of practice tests to make sure you'll pass the exam. It's that easy. While some training courses can cost you thousands of dollars other courses are entirely free.
