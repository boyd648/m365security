  <h2>What is the Microsoft 365 Security Administrator Certification?</h2>

  <p>The Microsoft 365 Security Administrator Certification is a digital badge that indicates you have the skills you need to work as a security administrator for an organization that uses Microsoft Office 365. It’s important to note that the certification doesn’t get you a job – you must work for an employer that recognizes the certification. But getting the certification does make it easier for you to find an employer who will hire you based on the certification. The certification is made up of two parts: A Microsoft 365: Security Administrator Core module and an elective module that you choose. The Core module focuses on security topics such as identity management, access control, risk management, and data privacy and protection. The Elective module allows you to focus on the skills you want to improve on – you can choose from 27 different topics.</p>
